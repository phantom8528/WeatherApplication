------------------------------------Gabriel Jefferson Stand-Up for 04/13/22----------------------------------------
1. What I did yesterday:
    * Created a function to take in user input of a valid city or zipcode, and return data endpoints.
    * Made some minor modifications to the html.
    * Created a second fetch in both functions to retrieve daily forcast data for a given city.
2. What I'm doing today:
    * Adding folder of icons to the local machine. 
    * Creating additional conditionals within both functions to manage edge cases from user-input.
    * Adding addition functionality to catch methods at the end of each fetch.
    * Formatting row 2, column 2 to accept other weather data
    * Assisting with any html/css issues that may be present. 
    * Assisting with 2nd api repairs or alternatives.
3. Blockers: 
    * Api wouldn't give me access to 7-Day forcast data.
