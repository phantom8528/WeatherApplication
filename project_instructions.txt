Frontend Project Details: 
- Create a web app that allows you to check the weather in different cities dynamicallyâ€¦ meaning I should be able to input some info and receive details back from the API. 
- The API to use can be found here: https://www.weatherapi.com/
- There should be a default city that displays its weather.
- Once you complete the base requirements, find another API to incorporate as well. Which API and how it integrates is up to you.
- Additional API resources and libraries can be found here: https://digitalcrafts.instructure.com/courses/188/pages/resources-for-projects-libraries-and-apis?module_item_id=22654
